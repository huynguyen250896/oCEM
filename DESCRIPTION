    c(person(given = "Quang-Huy",
           family = "Nguyen",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),

Description: oCEM possesses the decomposition methods with a 
    wholly automatic analysis framework to help non-technical users 
    to easily perform complicated statistical analyses and then detect 
    overlapping co-expressed gene modules. For further information on 
    requirements as well as how to implement this tool, please visit my
